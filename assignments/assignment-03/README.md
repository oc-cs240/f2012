### Description
Use PyGame to open a window and put a drawing on the screen. The window should be 640x480, with a pale blue background. Draw a rendition of the olympic flag in the center of the window. The drawing particulars are left underspecified, to allow your own artistic interpretation.

How To
------
Use [color](http://pygame.org/docs/ref/color.html) and [draw](http://pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html) modules from PyGame. For the background, do some investigation...

The window should stay open until closed by the user, either clicking on the window close box, or pressing 'q' on the keyboard.
